1:For every object unique number generated by JVM which is nothing but hashcode . hashcode won't represents
address of object.
2: JVM will use hashcode while saving object into hashing related data strucutre like hashtable, hashmap, hashset etc
3: the main advantage of saving objects based on hashcode is search operation will become easy(the most powerfull search
algorith upto today is hashing)

4: If we are giving chance to object class hashvoce method it will generate hashcode based on address of the object
    it does not mean it represent the address of object.
5: based on our requirement we can ovveride hashcode method in our class to generate our own hashcode.
