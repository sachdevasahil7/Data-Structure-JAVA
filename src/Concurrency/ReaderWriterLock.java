/*
Imagine you have an application where you have multiple readers and a single writer.
 You are asked to design a lock which lets multiple readers read at the same time,
 but only one writer write at a time.

Tips to help solve the problem:
Define the APIs your class will expose. In this case youâ€™ll need two for writer and two for reader. These are:
acquireReadLock
releaseReadLock
acquireWriteLock
releaseWriteLock

Think about each use case that you need to satisfy.
